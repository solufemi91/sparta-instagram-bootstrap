  * Your brief
  * What you found the most difficult thing to implement
  * What are you most pleased with

## What I found most difficult to implement

I found it very difficult to figure out how to prevent the rows stacking on top of it each other after screen width was less than 1200px. It required a lot of time checking and unchecking boxes on the Google Chrome Developer tool. Once I found a solution, I found it difficult to make the changes on my actual index html file because whenever I copied and pasted the media query syntax there was an error. However I managed to resolve this issue by re-writing the syntax.

I also found it very difficult to make my design responsive.

## What I am most pleased width

I am very pleased that I managed to prevent the rows from stacking on top of each other whenever the screen size was reduced.
